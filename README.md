# Biome-Feature-Generator-Prototype---Pygame-ce-
A procedural biome and feature generator built with Pygame CE. Includes music, a main menu, level creation and saving, animated tiles, chunk-based movement, world borders, and multiple algorithms that simulate terrain patterns like paths, patches, and distinct biome shapes.
